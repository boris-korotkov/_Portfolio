## Data Analytics Portfolio

1. ####  Descriptive analytics

   The very first experience with Python happened in the Data Science Program back in 2018 at University of Toronto.  The team of four people enjoyed the time together of slicing and dicing the Canadian Car Collision dataset (1994-2014) in Foundation of Data Science course project:

   `Toolset: Python, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn`

2. #### Machine Learning

   The next project was created by team of three students in the same Data Science Program.  The objective was to predict the house price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) was used for this project.  The Project was a training camp for features engineering, data pipelining, Regression models selection, hyperparameters tuning and optimization. The winner of the tough competition became the Gradient Boosting Regressor which gave the best result and got the submission rank of 1,340 out of 4,632, e.g. within top 30%.

3. #### Scala & Apache Spark MLlib

   Another interesting project completed in Data Science Program was Restaurant Review Rating Prediction using [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-reviews). In this project I built my foundation skills of Scala, Apache Spark MLlib, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). A free Databricks account was used to set up a Spark cluster.

4. #### Auto Machine Learning Frameworks comparison

   I enjoyed my machine learning experience, but it was really boring to select the best machine learning algorithm and tune the hyperparameters. Luckily, people around the globe shared my feelings and invented automated machine learning frameworks. I decided to select a few of them and compare the efforts and results with the Machine Learning project I had in Data Science course at University of Toronto. 

   Out of variety of options, I selected [Auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/index.html), [Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT)](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/), and [Fast and Lightweight AutoML (FLAML)](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML). I used the default settings in all frameworks and left the data preparation at the same level as an in original machine learning exercise.

   The Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/boris-korotkov/_Portfolio/blob/main/AutomML/AutoML_framework_comparison.ipynb

   I've got the super exciting result! The accuracy of Auto ML models was very close to the original super tuned machine learning project, but I spent minutes to write the code and train the model instead of many and many hours of work in the original project! I love automated machine learning!

   The best AutoML model out of three was TPOT one with R2 score equal to 0.9288 and the original top one was GradientBoostingRegressor with R2=0.9197.

   `Toolset: Python, Colab, Auto-sklearn, TPOT, FLAML`

5. #### Multi-Label classification using Text Analytics and Azure Machine Learning 
   The Multi-Label classification problem was solved using Natural Language Processing technique and Neural Network. The model was developed in Azure Machine Learning environment using Python SDK and deployed as a WebService with the REST API.

   The Python model training script: https://github.com/boris-korotkov/_Portfolio/blob/main/AzureML/Multi-label%20classification/keras_model_training.py
   
   `Toolset: Azure Machine Learning, Azure Python SDK, SKLearn, NLTK, Keras`
